<p>I'm a Northwestern University graduate and a San Francisco native. I'm passionate about African politics, policy, research, tech, and environmental issues and I'm looking for a job.</p>

<p>Until recently I was a research assistant for Professor Richard Joseph, a professor of political science at Northwestern, studying Nigerian politics. I worked on research projects on Boko Haram and the 2015 presidential election and its aftermath. I also managed his site and academic blog, <a href="https://africaplus.wordpress.com">AfricaPlus</a>.</p>

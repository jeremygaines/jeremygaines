I'm a Northwestern University undergraduate and a San Francisco native. I'm passionate about African politics, policy, research, tech, and environmental issues and I'm looking for a job.

Right now I'm a research assistant for Professor Richard Joseph, a professor of political science at Northwestern, studying Nigerian politics. I'm engaged in ongoing research projects on Boko Haram and the 2015 presidential election and its aftermath.
